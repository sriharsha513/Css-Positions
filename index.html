        Overflowing inline elements wrap onto a new line if possible — like this
        one containing text, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this

<!-- Exercise 1: Absolute Positioning
Create an HTML file with multiple div elements. Apply absolute positioning to one or more of the div elements, using the position: absolute property. Experiment with different values for top, bottom, left, and right to position the elements in various places on the page. -->

<!-- Exercise 2: Relative Positioning
Create an HTML file with a container div and multiple child div elements. Apply relative positioning to one or more of the child div elements, using the position: relative property. Experiment with different values for top, bottom, left, and right to shift the position of the elements relative to their original position. -->

<!-- Exercise 3: Fixed Positioning
Create an HTML file with a header div and a content div. Apply fixed positioning to the header div, using the position: fixed property. Experiment with different values for top, bottom, left, and right to fix the header at a specific position on the viewport while scrolling the page. -->

<!-- Exercise 4: Sticky Positioning
Create an HTML file with a navigation bar div. Apply sticky positioning to the navigation bar, using the position: sticky property. Experiment with different values for top, bottom, left, and right to make the navigation bar stick to a specific position on the viewport as the page is scrolled. -->

<!-- Exercise 5: Z-Index
Create an HTML file with overlapping div elements. Apply positioning and use the z-index property to control the stacking order of the elements. Experiment with different z-index values to change the order in which the elements are visually stacked. -->

<!-- Exercise 6: Float
Create an HTML file with multiple div elements. Apply the float property to some of the div elements, using values like left or right. Observe how the floated elements interact with the surrounding content and how the remaining content wraps around the floated elements. -->

<!-- Exercise 7: Inline Block
Create an HTML file with multiple elements. Apply the display: inline-block property to some of the elements. Experiment with different widths, heights, and margins to observe how the inline-block elements behave and interact with other elements. -->
